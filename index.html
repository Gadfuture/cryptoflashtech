    <section id="how-crypto-works">
        <h2>How Cryptocurrency Works in Trading and Stocks</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrency trading involves buying and selling digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Flash USDT on exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase. Unlike traditional stocks, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized blockchain networks, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. Traders capitalize on price volatility, buying low and selling high, or using derivatives like futures and options to hedge risks. Crypto markets run 24/7, offering constant opportunities. Flash USDT, for instance, is used for stable trading due to its peg to the US dollar, minimizing volatility risks. In contrast, stock trading occurs on centralized exchanges like NYSE, with fixed hours and regulated brokers. Cryptocurrencies can also be staked or used in DeFi for yield farming, unlike stocks, which rely on dividends or capital gains. Both assets require market analysis—technical for crypto, fundamental for stocks. Risks include high volatility in crypto and market corrections in stocks. Flash USDT’s 180-day validity makes it a unique tool for traders seeking stability in fast-paced markets.</p>
